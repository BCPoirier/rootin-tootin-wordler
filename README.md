# rootin-tootin-wordler
Meet the Rootin' Tootin' Wordler – an interactive Wordle game created as the final project for my Introduction to Computational Thinking course, which I took during the fall '23 semester at CU Boulder!

The course was taught by professor William Wright, and solidified my love for coding. This was my first big coding project!

The only thing to note – when downloading the Wordle words, make sure to put them in the same folder on your computer, and change the directory path in the .ipynb file to the folder's location!
The Wordler will tell you the rest of the instructions... enjoy!
